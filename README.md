# facebook-clone
For this project, i used html and css
For the videos and posts, i actually got those links directly from facebook.
For the logos, i got those pictures from the web while they were all alligned well styled with css.
This project is actually awesome as it showed me the power of plain html and css and just how much i have improved.
and though, the website is just a static non interactive website, i am still very glad and grateful to the me who did not give up to get to where i am.
